## Problem Title  
**SIH 1653: Web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software**  

## Problem Description  
**Background:** Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence, carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to the next higher grade for scientific manpower within DRDO.  

**Description:** Conducting unbiased and objective interviews is a challenging task. The process involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and evaluating responses from candidates. To ensure fairness, the questions asked should match the expertise of the applicant, and responses should be evaluated for their relevance.  

**Expected Solution:**  
The proposed solution should provide a **real-life Board Room experience** for both experts and candidates, beginning with ice-breaking questions and leading into **in-depth techno-managerial** discussions. It should:  
âœ… Provide **quantifiable scores** for both candidates and interviewers.  
âœ… Ensure **relevant questions** based on candidate expertise.  
âœ… **Grade candidate responses** for relevancy.  
âœ… Assist in arriving at an **overall subject knowledge score** to determine suitability for the role.
